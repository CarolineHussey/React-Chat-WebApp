#React Chat WebApp

This is a simple multi-route local web app built with React as part of the 'React - The Complete Guide 2024' by Maximillian SchwartzMuller on Udemy. This course is a React course so React code is walked through while CSS code is provided.

Use npm install & npm run dev to set up the local environment.  

The backend used in this app is the sample backend provided as part of the course content. Here is the link to the back end repository: https://github.com/academind/react-complete-guide-code/blob/zz-reactjs-summary-updated/extra-files/dummy-backend.zip.
